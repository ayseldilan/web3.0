## Introduction
This is a code repository for a practicing Web 3.0 methodologies, Solidity and Metamask with the goal to learn and practice  how to build a real Web 3.0 Application - from start to finish.

In this project i will practice and learn:
- How to connect a regular React.js application to the blockchain and pair it to your Ethereum wallet using MetaMask.
- I'll also learn how to write Smart Contracts on the Ethereum network using the #Solidity programming language
- Essentially, create a full-fledged Web 3.0 application that allows users to send transactions through the blockchain
